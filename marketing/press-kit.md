## üë®‚Äçüíª Founder Story

Live Media API was born from frustration with existing video solutions. After spending months implementing WebRTC for multiple projects, our founder realized developers needed a simpler solution.

**The Problem**: Existing video APIs were either too complex (raw WebRTC), too expensive (enterprise-only), or too restrictive (vendor lock-in).

**The Solution**: Abstract away all WebRTC complexity while maintaining full functionality and competitive pricing.

**The Result**: Developers can now add professional video chat to any application in under 5 minutes.
